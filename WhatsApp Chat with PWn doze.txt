These are rules for a chess tournament.
The scoring system as you can see is the same as in Norway Chess tournaments.
Format all this more formally.

Chess Tournament Rules:

Team Composition:
a. Each team can have a maximum of five players, out of which four players will play and one player will be a substitute.
b. The playing four can be selected in any order as per the team's decision.
c. Each team must have at least one male and one female player in the playing four.

Scoring:
a. The team will be awarded three points for a win against another team.
b. If the score between two teams is tied at 2-2, an Armageddon game will be played between any two players. The winner of the Armageddon game will be awarded two points, and the loser will be awarded one point.
c. In case of a tie in the overall standings, the first tie-breaker will be the number of points scored by all the boards of each team. If the tie persists, the direct encounter between the two teams will be considered only if the team has defeated the other one without an Armageddon against them. If the tie still persists, a Blitz tie-breaker will be played, and if there is a draw, an Armageddon game will be played to decide the winner.

Gameplay:
a. All teams must maintain a sheet of paper, on which they must write the order of their team before the start of a round. The opponents must check the paper before the round and sit accordingly. At the end of each round, the opponents must sign each other's sheets.
b. All FIDE rules of gameplay are applicable.
